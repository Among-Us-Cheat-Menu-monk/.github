## 🛠️ What Is the Cheat Menu?

The Among Us Cheat Menu is an in-game overlay loaded with powerful toggles and sliders that manipulate the game in real time. You can activate wallhack (ESP), instantly finish tasks, freeze votes, force Impostor roles, and a ton more—all with hotkeys and a clean UI.

It's not a one-trick hack. It’s an **all-in-one control panel** for trolling, dominating, or speedrunning the game like a god. 👁️💥
